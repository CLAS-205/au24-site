# Lesson 6: Word Endings

## Objectives

1. Become familiar with general endings
2. Introduce compound endings

## Endings as Suffixes

Suffixes are roots that attach to the ends of bases that can change the part of speech of the entire word. The suffixes that we’ll see in the book will create nouns, adjectives, and verbs.
Similar to how prefixes go before a base, suffixes go behind. So in these examples, the suffix -ac goes behind the base CARDI, which makes it an adjective meaning “heart-related”; and then -ic goes behind CHROMAT, which gives it the sense of something being “color-related”.

Both prefixes and suffixes can occur in the middle of a word or team up. So in this first case, you have the word spheroidal. -oid is a suffix which means “having the shape of”, or “having the form of”, which you’ll notice in the middle of the word. Similarly in pediatrician, the suffix -ic is occurring in the middle of the word. Now in both of these examples, they also have another suffix happening after them. In spheroidal,  you have -oid and -al. In the word pediatrician, you have -ic and -ian.

One of the key differences between endings and the other roots (prefixes and bases) in addition to position is that suffixes themselves are not actually from any specific part of speech. They are derived from patterns in how adjectives, verbs, and some nouns are formed in Greek. 
The book will tell you that some of the ones we’ve learned today are actually from Latin, but personally I don’t think the delineation there matters a whole lot. All that matters is that you learn them. I’ve also posted an index of “Greek” suffixes to Canvas. Don’t worry about memorizing all of them just yet, since the Greek-suffix index covers material from Lesson 4 all the way to Lesson 12. We’ll get to those in time.

[Adjective-forming suffixes]
The book will tell you that the suffixes you’ve learned today are adjective-forming suffixes. This means that the endings from today’s lesson will turn their respective words into adjectives. 
One thing to note is that, especially with words containing multiple suffixes, is that the last root will determine what part of speech the word is. Not every word will end in a suffix, but if it does, that suffix will determine the part of speech for the whole word– whether it’s a noun, an adjective, or a verb.
Let’s revisit an earlier example, using the two suffixes in spheroidal. Let’s start by breaking down this word into its roots. First, we have the base SPHER-, which means “sphere” in English; then the suffix -oid, meaning “having the shape of”; finally, the suffix -al, meaning “like” or “having the character of”. The base is a noun. Adding -oid changes SPHER- to spheroid and creates an adjective. Adding -al on top of that gives us spheroidal and lets us know that this word is an adjective. Now, in this example, we had two different suffixes with the same part of speech. It’s possible for some words to contain suffixes that create differing parts of speech. The important thing to remember is whatever suffix comes at the end of a word determines the part of speech of the entire word.
Let’s revisit pediatrician. When we break down this word into its roots, we have PED- (meaning “child”), IATR- (meaning “medicine”), and then two suffixes, -ic and -ian. PED- and IATR- are both nouns. The first suffix, -ic, creates an adjective. “pediatric” is an adjective meaning “pertaining to child medicine”. However, the second suffix, -ian, creates a noun. We haven’t learned this one in class yet, but this is a suffix that means “a person or thing which does or is X”, where X is whatever word came before.

[Practical considerations]
For the purposes of this class, all suffixes create only one part of speech. That means that any suffix introduced in an adjectives lesson, for example, will only create adjectives. Later, we’ll see suffixes that create nouns or verbs, but those suffixes will only create nouns or only create verbs. So when we talk about adjective-forming suffixes in this lesson, that means that words that end in any of the suffixes here will be adjectives. Practically speaking, that means you’ll always see them in a descriptive context, usually for other nouns.
That being said, the book does talk about some cases where the meaning of some adjectives has drifted over time to create nouns. For example, the word “thermodynamic” is an adjective whose literal meaning is something close to “pertaining to the movement of heat”. However, when you ad an “s” at the end to create “thermodynamics”, this definition becomes a certain field or area of study, and that itself is a noun. The main takeaway here is that while they’re not all practically adjectives, they all are descriptive words in some sense. And whenever you see these words on assessments or handouts, be sure you’re paying close attention to the original meanings of these suffixes so you know how the words are being used.

## Reflection Questions

1. Refer back to the words in Vocabulary Practice for Lessons 1-5. Choose 5 that have suffix endings. Give what part of speech each word is, and what its suffix means.

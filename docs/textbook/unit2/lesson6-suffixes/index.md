# Lesson 6: Word Endings

## Objectives

1. Become familiar with common endings in bioscientific vocabulary
2. Learn how endings affect parts of speech
3. Introduce compound endings

## Endings as Suffixes

**Suffixes** are roots that attach to the ends of words. So far, we've seen how some roots can change between being prefixes, bases, or suffixes depending on where they're found in a term. However, there are some root patterns that are usually found *only* at the ends of words. To distinguish these from suffixes in general, we'll call these roots **endings**. Endings differ from other roots in that they can't stand on their own. However, they do govern the part of speech of the entire word&mdash; creating adjectives, nouns, or verbs.

Let's look at some examples:

- **cardi** + *-ac* = cardiac, "heart-related"
- **chromat** + *-ic* = chromatic, "color-related"
- **spher** + *-oid* = spheroid, "sphere-shaped"

> To distinguish endings from other roots, we'll always put a - in front of them, as above.

One of the key differences between endings and the other roots in addition to position is that endings themselves are not actually from any specific part of speech. They are derived from patterns in how adjectives, verbs, and some nouns are formed in Greek and Latin, as we've seen in Lesson 3.

For our purposes, most endings create only one part of speech. That means that any ending introduced in the adjectives table, for example, will only create adjectives. However, there are some cases where it's not clear what part of speech is created from an ending. For example, **hydrate** can be a verb, meaning to fill something with water. **Hydrate** can also be a noun indicating a hydrogen compound. To avoid ambiguity in assignments, we'll use the following shorthand:

- (n.) for nouns
- (a.) for adjectives
- (v.) for verbs

> Context is also important! Be sure you’re paying close attention to the original meanings of these suffixes so you know how the words are being used.

### Noun-Forming Endings

As the name suggests, **noun-forming endings** are endings that form nouns. Generally, these endings will denote a quality, process, or state of being. The language of origin is omitted from these charts because the origin of an ending doesn't really affect whether it attaches to Greek roots or Latin roots. 

Common noun-forming endings include:

| Root          | Meaning                       | Example           |
| :---:         | :---                          | :---              |
| -ter/-tor     | means of, place for           | theater           |
| -ist/-ast     | one who                       | dentist           |
| -te/-t        | one who, that which           | gamete            |
| -ia/-y        | state of, condition, quality  | dyslexia          |
| -ism          | condition of                  | alcoholism        |
| -sis/-sia/-sy | act of, process of            | thesis            |
| -ma/-m/-me    | result of                     | enzyme            |
| -oma(t)       | tumor of                      | sarcoma           |
| -osis         | disease of                    | psychosis         |
| -itis         | inflammation of               | appendicitis      |
| -in/-ine      | chemical substance of         | morphine          |
| -us           | individual, person who        | sarcophagus       |
| -id           | related to, resembling        | arachnid          |
| (Start Latin suffixes)

> This is not an exhaustive list. We'll see more noun-forming endings and their specific use cases in Lesson 8.

### Adjective-Forming Endings

Endings in this table turn their words into adjectives. Many of these overlap with suffixes that you've seen in Lesson 3. Unlike nouns, it's harder to give definitions for adjective-forming endings. Many of them will amount to "like", "related to", or "pertaining to". It's easier to see the force of these endings in context.

### Verb-Forming Endings

Compared to noun-forming and adjective-forming suffixes, the verb-forming suffixes are few. Still, it's important to know these since they usually denote a process that something undergoes, rather than direct action.

## Compound Endings

It's possible for one word to have many endings tacked onto each other! The rule of thumb is that the *very last* ending is what determines what part of speech a term is.

Let’s revisit an earlier example, using the two suffixes in spheroidal. Let’s start by breaking down this word into its roots. First, we have the base SPHER-, which means “sphere” in English; then the suffix -oid, meaning “having the shape of”; finally, the suffix -al, meaning “like” or “having the character of”. The base is a noun. Adding -oid changes SPHER- to spheroid and creates an adjective. Adding -al on top of that gives us spheroidal and lets us know that this word is an adjective. Now, in this example, we had two different suffixes with the same part of speech. It’s possible for some words to contain suffixes that create differing parts of speech. The important thing to remember is whatever suffix comes at the end of a word determines the part of speech of the entire word.

Both prefixes and suffixes can occur in the middle of a word or team up. So in this first case, you have the word spheroidal. -oid is a suffix which means “having the shape of”, or “having the form of”, which you’ll notice in the middle of the word. Similarly in pediatrician, the suffix -ic is occurring in the middle of the word. Now in both of these examples, they also have another suffix happening after them. In spheroidal,  you have -oid and -al. In the word pediatrician, you have -ic and -ian.

## Vocabulary list

| Root          | Language of origin    | Meaning                   | Example           |
| :---:         | :---:                 | :---                      | :---              |

## Vocabulary Practice

**Practice Set A:** Based on the final ending in each word, tell what part of speech it is. (If it could be multiple, give all possibilities.)

1. thermodynamic
2. thermodynamics
3. analysis
4. melanoma
5. petrify
6. petrification
7. arrhythmia
8. dystrophy
9. convalescent
10. synthesize

**Practice Set B:** Identify the roots in each of the following words, give their language of origin, and their definitions. Then, following the guidelines in Lesson 4, arrange the definitions of the individual roots to create a literal definition.

## Reflection Questions

1. Refer back to the words in Vocabulary Practice for Lessons 1-5. Choose 5 that have suffix endings. Give what part of speech each word is, and what its suffix means.
2. Take any two of the example words from this lesson and change them to another part of speech using a suffix ending. (It doesn't have to create an actual English word.)
3. Based on what you know about Latin and Greek morphology and the suffixes from Lesson 3, can you figure out what the original Latin or Greek form of any of the endings are?
4. How have you seen these endings used in words outside what you've learned in the vocabulary for this class?

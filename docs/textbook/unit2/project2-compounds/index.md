# Project 2: Compounding Terms
{: .no_toc}

## Objectives
{: .no_toc}

1. Apply knowledge of Greek and Latin roots to determine meanings of chemical compound names
2. Understand how endings change the meanings of words
3. Connect naming conventions with the shapes of molecules, polymers, and other compounds.

## Relevance
{: .no_toc}

In this project, you will examine the names of elements and chemical compounds to explore how endings affect the meanings of these names. While the bases in chemical names can provide clearer clues to their core components, the endings are important when it comes to figuring out more details about chemical properties, bonds, and structures. By interpreting how Greek and Latin are used in chemical naming, you'll develop a better sense for the subtle ways in which endings can provide more information about unfamiliar terms! (Don't worry&mdash; you won't have to balance any equations!)

## Problem 1: Elementary, My Dear Watson

The following elements from the periodic table use Latin- or Greek-based names with diminutive endings. Interpret the meanings of each of the elements' names. Then, look up what the element is used for/in and tell whether you think this name is appropriate or not. Recall that a diminutive just means "little"!

1. Helium
2. Lithium
3. Chromium
4. Tellurium
5. Radium 

## Problem 2: Gods Against Humanity

These elements all include references to Greek and Roman mythological figures in their names. Give the figure, what the figure represents, and why the element was named after that figure. Then, tell whether you think this name is appropriate. (Think back to the discussions about Linnaeus' tendency to name organisms after his friends.)

1. Titanium
2. Promethium
3. Plutonium
4. Tantalum
5. Palladium

## Problem 3

Using context clues to figure out the difference between chemical endings (e.g., -ide vs. -ate)

## Problem 4 

Use number prefixes 

## Problm 5

Matching molecules to their pictures

## Problem 6

Polymers

## Challenge Problem:

Some elements' chemical symbols come from their Latin names instead of their English names. Pick one such element and write a short essay about it (200-300 words). Include the following details:

- The element's Latin name and what it means
- When the element was discovered
- When the element was added to the periodic table
- Why the element's Latin name is used instead of its English one
- Historical details about how the element was used or considered by pre-modern scientists
- How the element is used today

Examples include (but are not limited to):

- Sodium (Na)
- Potassium (K)
- Iron (Fe)
- Silver (Ag)
- Gold (Au)
- Tin (Sn)
- Mercury (Hg)
- Antimony (Sb)
- Copper (Cu)
- Lead (Pb)

## Roman Numerals Review

Recall that the Roman numeral system is based on letters to represent numeric values. Roman numerals are formed by combining letters in order from greatest values to least values, then adding them together. Here is a numeral-to-number conversion chart, for your convenience:

| Roman Numeral | Hindu-Arabic Value |
| :---:         | :---:              |
| I             | 1                  |
| V             | 5                  |
| X             | 10                 |
| L             | 50                 |
| C             | 100                |
| D             | 500                |
| M             | 1000               |

As an example, the Roman numeral XVII would be 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 17.

## Reflection Questions

1. Compare and contrast the methods of Roman arithmetic with the arithmetic we're familiar with (using Hindu-Arabic numerals). Which system is more efficient, and why?

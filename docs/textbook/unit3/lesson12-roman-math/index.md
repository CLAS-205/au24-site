## Roman Numerals Review

Recall that the Roman numeral system is based on letters to represent numeric values. Roman numerals are formed by combining letters in order from greatest values to least values, then adding them together. Here is a numeral-to-number conversion chart, for your convenience:

| Roman Numeral | Hindu-Arabic Value |
| :---:         | :---:              |
| I             | 1                  |
| V             | 5                  |
| X             | 10                 |
| L             | 50                 |
| C             | 100                |
| D             | 500                |
| M             | 1000               |

As an example, the Roman numeral XVII would be 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 17.

## Roman Arithmetic

We also discussed

### Addition

Let's start off simple. Let's look at additions. When you were first taught addition, I believe you were taught to take two or more numbers, arrange them so that their place values align, and then you would go place by place and add up all the values in each place. You would add up your ones, your tens, your hundreds and so on. When you arrived at a value that exceeded ten, you would keep the terminal value but regroup the other value. Repeat until you were done.
The Roman number system isn’t base-10 the way our modern Hindu-Arabic number system is. But there is the idea of arrangements and pseudo-place values. The first step is to take two or more numbers together and put their letters together, ordering them from least to greatest.
Let’s illustrate with an example. Let’s take 14 + 39. Here, I’ll represent both numbers with the additive system, and I’ll explain why in a little bit. 
14 is represented by XIIII, and 39 is represented as XXXVIIII. When we smush all these letters together, we get this massive string of X’s, a V, and a lot of I’s. We arrange the letters from greatest to least, meaning all the X’s get grouped together, followed by the V, then followed by all the I’s.
The next step that happens is that you make conversions as necessary, starting from the smallest letters to the largest ones. 
So what this means is that we have eight I’s. We can grab a V out of that, turn that into a five, and we can take the two V's and turn them into another X. We would have five X's, which we can convert to L. 
At the very end, you would take whatever number you end up with, and then you just interpret it. L is 50, and the three I’s are the number 3, so altogether we would arrive at 53. If you enter 14 + 39 into a calculator or add this by hand, you will see that it does indeed add up to 53. Neat, right?

### Subtraction

With subtraction, unlike addition, you can only use two numbers at a time. Here, I'll use the example of 37 -14 which is represented here as XXXVII minus XIIII. And again, I'm using the additive system here. I'm not going to belabor the point, but subtraction in the Roman arithmetic system doesn't work with subtractive numbers. You can try this example on your own with the subtractive system and see why it doesn’t work. 
The first step in Roman subtraction, as with modern subtraction, is to set up the larger number in front of the smaller one. Theoretically, the order wouldn’t matter as long as you knew which one was greater, but traditionally the larger number is on the left.
The next step is crossing out or erasing any letters in the first number that appear in the second one. Here, I've made the “erased” letters just a lighter color. We are able to erase an X and two I’s from both numbers. 
After that, if there's any numbers remaining in the second or smaller number, then we convert the smallest letter of the first number that is greater than the largest letter of the second. And you keep repeating this process until there's no more letters in the second number. 
What this looks like is we first look for the smallest letter in the first number which is greater than the largest letter of the second number. So the smallest is going to be V (5), which is greater than the largest letter I (1). We take the V, we turn it into five I's, and then we're able to cross out the remaining two I's from each number.
All we're left with is XXIII, and then we can interpret the remaining letters and then we get 23. And you'll see, like in the Hindu-Arabic number system, 37 -14 is indeed 23. So that's addition and subtraction. 

### Multiplication

The Romans also had an interesting way they did multiplication. I'm going to talk about the algorithm for how they do this first before giving the example, because I think it helps to have all the steps out first before seeing the example. So unlike modern multiplication where we can just multiply a whole bunch of numbers in straight sequence, the Roman algorithm for multiplying numbers can only do two at a time. The two numbers are set up in a table. It doesn't matter which number goes where. Usually the smaller number is put on the left side and the greater number is put on the right side. 
And the reason why this is, is because you have these two columns in a table. You take repeated halves for the first number by doing subtraction, and then you take repeated doubles for the second number by doing addition. And when you're halving the first number, you basically ignore any remainders. In modern mathematical terminology, we would say that you are “flooring” the halves.
The process continues until you've reached the number one in the half column, at which point you cross out any row where the half column is even. 
Finally, After all the rows are crossed out, you add the remaining doubles to get the final product.
Now, this was a lot of just me talking, so I'm going to represent this with the expression 14 times 39. 
The first step is putting these two numbers into a table, labeling one column as halves and one column as doubles. And I've put the number 14 on the left side and the number 39 on the right side. Traditionally, the smaller number is put on the left side because there are fewer halves to go through.
The second step is to keep continually taking halves of these numbers while disregarding any remainders or decimal places. For example, when you move from seven to three, seven divided by two would be 3.5 or three remainder one. You get rid of the remainder, or you just use the floor function, and you are left with 3. Then three divided by two, floored, is going to be one again.
Now, for each time that you take a half , you would double the number in the doubles column using addition. 
I'm copying the table here so that I can demonstrate step three, which is crossing out any row where the number in the “half” column is an even number. Here, because 14 is even, we cross out the entire row of 14 and 39. Seven, three and one are all odd, so their respective rows get to stay as is. 
Finally, the last step is taking all of the numbers from the doubles column and adding them together. So we have 78, 156 and 312. And then we use the regular method of addition to arrive at 546. You can try out the addition here for yourself, if you’d like. You can actually verify with your calculator that 14 times 39 is indeed 546. 
I'm sure the Romans probably had some idea of the commutativity of multiplication, meaning it doesn't actually matter which number starts off in which column, but it certainly makes your life easier if the smaller number is put into the halves column. If we had 39 on the left, we’d have to go through 39, then 19, then 9, then 4, then 2, then 1, which is six rows. When we started at 14, we only had to do four rows!

### Division?
Did the Romans have division? Not exactly. Practically speaking, they had some concept of unit fractions, as in being one part out of two, one part out of six, one part out of eight, et cetera. But there's no real concept of division. They didn’t really have any concept of more complex fractions that we have, such as five-eights or two-sevenths. 
They did have the idea of division in terms of monetary units, because monetary units in the Roman Empire were given in twelfths. So you could have one-twelfth of something, you could have one-sixth of something, one-fourth, one-third and one-half, and you could probably do addition between all of these as well. There must have been some concept of common factors, since there was an awareness that six, four, and three all divide 12. But in terms of division, the way that we could conceive of it in the modern day, there was no real equivalent in the Roman world or any intuitions or algorithms for solving those kinds of problems. 
Now, that's kind of interesting, because the words decimal and percent are both from Latin. The word decimal has the root for the word ten, decem, and percent has that prefix per-, which we've seen before. And then -cent comes from the Latin word centum, meaning 100. But there really is no evidence for understanding either what a decimal or a percent is in ancient Rome, at least the way that we conceive of these in the modern day. 
And even though I gave kind of representations for the different algorithms that the Romans used to represent addition, subtraction, and multiplication, these operations were actually rather done on these hand abaci, or kind of proto-calculators, if you will; they weren't written out the same way that we would. 
Here's one example of an abacus that could have been used in Rome. This would have mostly been used for people who were merchants or real estate brokers, people who were looking at divisions of land or calculating sums of money. If you'll notice, there are three divots on the far right-hand side that don't have any beads in them. Some scholars think that those divots were used to represent units of money or land value, maybe negative values, but we’re not completely sure. For the most part, there wasn't a lot of practical math in terms of arithmetic, certainly not something as advanced as even basic algebra, and certainly calculus, the way that we would understand today. 
Numbers, as far as the numeric system that I've taught you in this video, were mostly used for records and inscriptions. These would be things like determining somebody's age or the year, or maybe even the number of people in a certain legion or military faction. That's what numbers were used for, not necessarily math the way that we would understand it.

## Roman Engineering

So let's talk about engineering in Ancient Rome. Most of the structures and systems that I’ll describe here were developed and instituted in the late Monarchy or early Republic periods, but they were improved during the late Republic and early Empire, under Augustus.

### Aqueducts

One of the most famous, recognizable feats of Roman engineering was the aqueduct. And we've had both of those bases before: AQU-, meaning “water”, and DUCT-, meaning “to lead”. So an aqueduct is a structure which leads water. 
The aqueducts were part of a giant water supply system for both irrigation and purification. They were created to move water from reservoirs or basins into different parts of Rome. And because about 80% to 90% of the economy was built on agriculture, it was important to have a way to water all sizes and manners of fields, especially as Rome grew bigger. The development of aqueducts ensured that agriculture could thrive at a time when the economy and people's forms of payment were very dependent on it. 
The way that the aqueducts were designed also lent itself to a sort of proto-system of water purification. Here are a couple of diagrams that can help illustrate the way they work. Aqueducts were constructed in layers, as you can see here, with the different colors. The layers would be constructed in such a way that water would flow across the top of the aqueduct and continuously be flowing downhill. As the water flowed, any sediment or impurities would naturally drop out into the gravel that filled the aqueduct layers.
Often, when we think about aqueducts, we imagine these distinctive arch patterns. These are called “arcades”. The arches aren’t just decorative–they’re actually a clever way to both conserve resources and control the flow of water. An arch, when constructed well, can support the same amount of weight that a full wall would, with about half the materials. Additionally–and it’s not obvious from this picture–but when two arches are placed next to each other, there’s a natural divot between them, a sort of valley between the two vertices of the arches. The Romans didn’t fill these in, so that the water would continually move up and down. It only looks like a filled-in wall on the outside, so that the water doesn’t leak out. Arches are also important because they can support weight better than perpendicular columns, particularly when the weights that they support are composed of many small bricks instead of a large stone slab. Because the stones in the middle of the arch are already held in place through tension and compression, there’s no need to create additional support structures for smaller brick layers.
Many aqueducts were built during the Republic, but there wasn't really a lot of upkeep or maintenance on them until Augustus became the first emperor. Augustus had a friend named Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who was an architect and civil engineer. Agrippa pioneered the renovation of much of the Roman infrastructure, including standardizing Roman aqueducts and improving their water flow.
What's really cool about the aqueducts is that they were built all over the Roman Empire–many of which you can still see today! The Romans actually got about as far as Spain and France at the height of their conquest, so there are surviving aqueducts in these regions. 
The top picture shows an aqueduct in the city of Segovia, in southern Spain. Note the double arching going on! We have one layer of arches here and then another layer of arches going at the top. 
Here's another picture of an aqueduct at the Pont du Gard in France, which is actually the tallest surviving aqueduct left over from the Roman empire. So that's pretty cool. 

### Sewers

A cousin of the aqueduct is the Roman drainage system. Some aqueducts themselves were tunnels, whose primary function was to remove unwanted water and waste. One of the things that kind of set Rome apart from many of the other contemporary civilizations and cultures of its time is that it actually did have a pretty well functioning drainage system. 
Recall from the health and medicine lesson that Rome is situated around a river, surrounded by hills and lowlands, which means that there are many natural springs. The combination of these led to many concerns about flooding. Seattle is actually a good analogue here, since there are a lot of hills downtown with not many storm drains. If you’ve ever been downtown on a particularly rainy day, you’ll notice that the rainwater gathers in the lowlands; without an effective way of draining that water, roads and buildings will get submerged and damaged. Rome's sewage system or its drainage system first started out as a way to mitigate flood concerns, but eventually it also turned into a way to get rid of any waste or get rid of sewage. 
The way that we would think of kind of sewage being transported today is that we would have indoor plumbing, and then we would flush toilets or get rid of things down sinks, and then there was a series of pipes that takes things into sewers and then deposits them into a waste. The Romans didn't actually have a lot of indoor plumbing. There were a few indoor household toilets, but these were very few and far between. This is a little gross, but waste was usually dumped straight into the streets. Part of the reason for this is that not only were the streets, probably a more reliable way of making sure that the waste actually got into the sewers, but also if the sewers were attached to people's houses, a lot of the disease and filth that went through them would have appeared in people’s homes. In addition to that, the sewers were a place where there were a lot of rats. Thus, in addition to disease and human waste, there was the risk of an infestation of rats or other creatures. 
There's actually a funny anecdote from a Roman writer named Aelian about a sewage opening near a fishery. He wrote that there was a very persistent octopus that lived in a sewer next to the fish market. Every once in a while, it would creep out, steal some fish, and make off with them. So, in other words, you could get quite unexpected visitors if you had the sewage openings right near your house or even your place of commerce! 
That being said, the drainage system itself was relatively well developed, even to the point where a lot of other writers around the Mediterranean marveled at it when they visited Rome. The first and most well known drain that was established in Rome, was called the Cloaca Maxima, and it basically just means giant drain. This is also one of the works that Agrippa, who I mentioned on the previous slides, was responsible for.

### Roads

Now, I mentioned that one of the reasons why waste was dumped into the streets rather than being taken care of at home is because the roads themselves were actually quite helpful, especially in the later Roman Empire. 
There were three kinds of roads that were recognized or used during the Roman Empire. So we have your via [pronounced “wee-ya”], which are large roads, usually outside the city of Rome, some within the city of Rome as well, being named after famous people or the people who constructed them. Or even one example is the Via Sacra, which just means “sacred road”, which is where all the temples were at and where festivals and processions would take place. But during the Roman Empire, the via would have been considered larger roads that are usually outside the city of Rome. If you look at a map of Europe today and look at the major roads there, and you compare it against a map of where the ancient Roman roads were, you'll notice that a lot of the routes are the same. That’s also where we also get the saying that “all roads lead to Rome”. 
Then you have your vicus [pronounced “wick-us”], which is the flat in-city road. Finally, you have your clivus, which is your inclined in-city roads. So I think the word inclined and clivus actually have the same “cli-”base there, which shows that a road is going uphill or downhill. 
The early roads at the founding of the Roman city and during the monarchy probably would have been paved only with dirt. 
As the city grew and more people needed to use the roads, they would have added gravel and stone layers later. Some of these roads, especially as they developed alongside the sewage system, would have gutters along the sides, and they would also have some stepping-stones, like a crosswalk. 
Here are some examples of roads that were unearthed at Pompeii. In this first one, there are little divots in the side here where the sewage probably would have flowed down and gone into the drainage system. There are stepping-stones here as well. What's kind of neat about this picture on the right is that there's actually some tracks left over from what we think might be a cart or a chariot. Archaeologists are not sure if there were actually designated roads that only chariots or carts could have been drawn down, but it's neat to see that the tracks still remain there today.

### War Machines

Roads were also quite important for the military, which was also a huge source of engineering developments. As we saw in the health and medicine lesson, the military gave legitimacy to doctors; beyond that, they also gave legitimacy to engineers. The class of engineers were actually called immunes alongside the regular soldiers. This is where we get the word “immune” from. 
The immunes would have been soldiers first, but they were excused from normal military duties. They would have taken on roles similar to modern-day civil engineers. The engineers were also called fabri, which means “craftsmen”, or architecti, which means “arch-builders”. It’s important to realize that architecti didn’t only build arches, though.
As the Roman army progressed, they would build their own roads, their own bridges, other fortifications, even aqueducts, alongside the progression of the army. 
And most of these were designed to be deconstructed after use. Julius Caesar tells us quite a bit about military engineering during campaigns. One of the most famous bridges that his army built was along the Rhine river. His army built and deconstructed the same bridge across the river in about ten days. They built the bridge, they went across it, and then they packed it up. So a lot of these structures were just meant to be deconstructed after use. 
But some of them, like we saw the valetudinaria in the health lesson, were left behind the roads as well, because the roads would have been. It would have been more efficient to just keep the roads there. And then later, when whatever place that the army went to conquer became a province, those roads could be used for things like trade and commerce anyways. 
And then the hospitals, as we discussed, were often left behind because the wounded soldiers would not be able to move with the army anyway, and so those camps would just be left behind. I found this representation of a Roman camp. The Roman camps were called castra, which just means tents. Fun fact about the word castra is that it’s cognate with the toponym -chester in English. So if you go to the UK, any town or city that ends in -chester (like Manchester or Chichester), used to be a place where the Romans once set up a military camp. 
But going back to the castra themselves– the way that the tents were usually built is that they do have a series of tents kind of arranged in a certain way, and then there would be these fortifications built around them. And it was difficult for me to see if there's actually a representation of valetudinaria or the hospitals in here, but I believe it would have been these longer tents over at the side. They’re sheltered away from the main entrances, but they’re also guarded by the walls. 
In terms of military structures, there are the structures that the military uses for practical purposes, in terms of moving the army along and building bridges. But what's also interesting is that the military, when they were not actively at war, were also basically just construction workers. Part of a Roman soldier's toolkit would have been a spear, a sword, and a short shovel because they had to do a lot of digging to build these roads, to build these bridges. Many Roman writers actually attest to the fact that when the army didn't really have anything to do, they would just be assigned these civil engineering projects, because they believed that if the army didn't have anything to do, then they would try to mutiny or they would try to run way and not actually be active participants in the military. The neat thing about this is that if you consider that all Roman men had mandatory military service, most of the Roman male population would have had this hands-on experience with engineering, even if they never learned it mathematically the way that engineering is taught today.

## Reflection Questions

1. Compare and contrast the methods of Roman arithmetic with the arithmetic we're familiar with (using Hindu-Arabic numerals). Which system is more efficient, and why?
2. Try your hand at some Roman arithmetic! Give a simple one-operation expression (with both numbers being at least 10, such as 29 + 14) and evaluate it according to the Roman method.
3. Look back at the map of Roman roads across Europe and recall how the Roman army was responsible for creating most of its own infrastructure. What can you imply from the distribution and spread of Roman roads?
4. What differences and similarities do you see between Greek and Roman mathematics?

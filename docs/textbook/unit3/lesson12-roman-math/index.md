## Roman Numerals Review

Recall that the Roman numeral system is based on letters to represent numeric values. Roman numerals are formed by combining letters in order from greatest values to least values, then adding them together. Here is a numeral-to-number conversion chart, for your convenience:

| Roman Numeral | Hindu-Arabic Value |
| :---:         | :---:              |
| I             | 1                  |
| V             | 5                  |
| X             | 10                 |
| L             | 50                 |
| C             | 100                |
| D             | 500                |
| M             | 1000               |

As an example, the Roman numeral XVII would be 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 17.

## Vocabulary Practice

**Practice Set B:** Identify the roots in each of the following words, give their language of origin, and their definitions. Also give their part of speech. Then, following the guidelines in Lesson 4, arrange the definitions of the individual roots to create a literal definition.

2. secant
3. arctangent

## Reflection Questions

1. Compare and contrast the methods of Roman arithmetic with the arithmetic we're familiar with (using Hindu-Arabic numerals). Which system is more efficient, and why?
2. Try your hand at some Roman arithmetic! Give a simple one-operation expression (with both numbers being at least 10, such as 29 + 14) and evaluate it according to the Roman method.
3. Look back at the map of Roman roads across Europe and recall how the Roman army was responsible for creating most of its own infrastructure. What can you imply from the distribution and spread of Roman roads?
4. What differences and similarities do you see between Greek and Roman mathematics?

## What is the Classical Tradition?

The Classical Tradition refers to the influence of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations on various fields of knowledge, culture, and intellectual pursuits, which has continued to shape Western thought and learning for centuries. It includes the study of philosophy, literature, mathematics, art, architecture, and science, all of which were foundational to the development of modern society. The Classical Tradition encompasses the language, ideas, and systems of knowledge passed down from these ancient cultures, particularly their ideas about the natural world, human nature, and the universe.

In the context of the sciences, the Classical Tradition is especially important because it laid the groundwork for many scientific disciplines. Ancient Greek philosophers, mathematicians, and naturalists such as **Aristotle**, **Euclid**, **Pythagoras**, and **Archimedes** made groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of geometry, astronomy, physics, and biology. Their work formed the basis of scientific thought until the development of modern science in the Renaissance and beyond. Likewise, the Romans, though more focused on engineering and practical applications, contributed to the development of scientific techniques and methods.

The influence of the Classical Tradition extends far beyond the ancient world. During the Middle Ages, scholars in the Islamic world, and later in Renaissance Europe, preserved, studied, and expanded upon Greek and Roman knowledge. The **Greek language** and **Latin** became the international languages of learning, science, and medicine, serving as the vehicles through which much of the ancient world’s knowledge was passed down to later generations. Today, many modern scientific terms, especially in fields like biology, chemistry, and medicine, are derived from Greek and Latin roots. These languages continue to provide a foundation for much of the terminology used in the sciences, highlighting the lasting influence of the Classical Tradition.

Through the centuries, the Classical Tradition has shaped not only scientific thought but also Western cultural identity, influencing everything from art and literature to political theory and ethics. The pursuit of knowledge and rational inquiry that began with the Greeks and Romans is at the core of modern scientific methods, demonstrating the enduring legacy of these ancient cultures. In a sense, the Classical Tradition is not merely a historical period, but an ongoing intellectual legacy that continues to inform how we approach the natural world, human society, and the universe.

### Greek and Latin in Sciences

Greek and Latin have been fundamental to the development and communication of scientific knowledge throughout history. These languages were adopted by scholars in the Western world for centuries, becoming the lingua franca of academia, especially during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Even today, many scientific terms and nomenclature are derived from these classical languages, as they continue to provide a universal framework for global scientific discourse.

**Greek**, in particular, is the language from which many of the foundational terms of scientific thought were derived, especially in fields like **biology**, **astronomy**, **physics**, and **medicine**. For example, the Greek root "bio-" means life, which appears in words like **biology** (the study of life), **biography** (the story of someone's life), and **biotechnology** (the use of living organisms in technology). Similarly, Greek prefixes such as "geo-" (earth), "astro-" (star), and "photo-" (light) are used in a wide array of scientific fields, from **geology** (the study of the earth), **astronomy** (the study of stars and planets), to **photosynthesis** (the process by which plants use light to make food).

The **Greek alphabet** also contributed significantly to modern scientific notation. For example, the use of Greek letters like **delta (Δ)** for change, **sigma (Σ)** for summation, and **pi (π)** for the mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, all have their roots in ancient Greek science and mathematics. The use of Greek in the sciences, particularly in technical writing and mathematical notation, remains pervasive today, maintaining its historical connection to ancient discoveries and systems of thought.

**Latin**, on the other hand, became the language of choice for formal writing in medieval Europe and was widely used throughout the Renaissance. It was the primary language for scientific texts, medical treatises, and theological writings. Latin's grammatical structure and vocabulary allowed scholars to precisely define concepts and ideas. For example, **scientific binomials**, the two-part naming system used to identify species, are written in Latin: *Homo sapiens* (humankind), *Panthera leo* (lion), and *Canis lupus* (wolf). Latin also remains prominent in the nomenclature of the **human anatomy** (e.g., *musculus* for muscle, *os* for bone, and *venae* for veins).

Both Greek and Latin provided a stable and universal medium for the exchange of scientific ideas across cultures. As the scientific revolution unfolded in the 16th and 17th centuries, scholars from different parts of Europe, often speaking different native languages, were able to communicate effectively through the shared use of Greek and Latin. This linguistic unity helped propel scientific collaboration and the dissemination of new knowledge. Even as national languages became more dominant in the 19th and 20th centuries, the legacy of Greek and Latin in scientific terminology continued, ensuring consistency and clarity in scientific communication worldwide.

### Mythological Figures in Science

Mythological figures have long played an important role in the naming of celestial objects, scientific discoveries, and even scientific theories. These names often reflect the symbolism, cultural significance, or perceived attributes of the figures from ancient mythology, and they have helped shape how we understand the world around us. In many ways, the mythological connections in science bridge the realms of ancient belief and modern inquiry, illustrating how early humans used stories and symbolism to explain the mysteries of nature.

One of the most prominent ways mythological figures are referenced in science is through the naming of celestial objects, particularly planets, moons, and asteroids. For instance, **planets** in our solar system are named after Roman gods, each of whom was associated with certain aspects of life, nature, or human experience. **Jupiter**, the king of the Roman gods, gives its name to the largest planet in our solar system, symbolizing power and grandeur. **Venus**, named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, is the second planet from the Sun and is often noted for its stunning appearance in the sky. **Mars**, named after the god of war, is characterized by its reddish appearance, evoking images of blood and conflict.

The naming of **moons** and **asteroids** has also drawn heavily from mythology. For example, **Titan**, the largest moon of Saturn, is named after the Titans in Greek mythology, who were primordial beings of great power. Similarly, **Io**, another of Jupiter’s moons, is named after a mortal lover of Zeus (the Greek counterpart of Jupiter). Even asteroids are often named after figures from mythology, such as **Ceres** (after the Roman goddess of agriculture) and **Vesta** (the Roman goddess of the hearth). These mythological names often reflect the astronomical bodies' characteristics, historical significance, or symbolic associations.

In addition to celestial objects, mythological figures are also frequently referenced in scientific terminology. For example, the term **tantalize**, used to describe something that is just out of reach, comes from the Greek myth of **King Tantalus**, who was condemned to stand in water that receded every time he tried to drink. The field of **psychology** takes its name from **Psyche**, the Greek goddess of the soul. The connection between mythology and science serves as a reminder of how our ancestors used myth to interpret the natural world, and how these interpretations have influenced the language of science today.

The inclusion of mythological figures in the naming of scientific discoveries and concepts also reflects the human tendency to personify abstract ideas. In this way, mythology helped early scientists convey complex phenomena in more relatable and human terms. The use of mythological names and references continues today, not only in astronomy but also in other fields such as medicine, physics, and chemistry. For instance, the **Hadron Collider** is named after the Greek word **hadros**, meaning "thick," reflecting the energy and force of the particles it collides. Similarly, the naming of **Hercules clusters** in astronomy is a nod to the strength and heroism associated with the mythological figure of Hercules.

Thus, the names of many scientific objects and concepts draw from the rich reservoir of mythological figures, blending the imaginative interpretations of ancient cultures with the empirical discoveries of modern science. These names serve as a bridge between myth and reality, helping us understand how early human cultures sought to make sense of the world and how their stories continue to shape the way we think about science today.

## The Language(s) of Science

The language of science is central to how knowledge is communicated, shared, and expanded upon across cultures and time periods. For much of modern history, **Greek** and **Latin** dominated the vocabulary and structure of scientific writing, becoming the lingua franca for scholars across Europe and, eventually, the world. These languages were not only used to describe and catalog natural phenomena, but also served as the basis for the terminology that continues to be used in a wide variety of scientific fields today. 

The relationship between language and science is not just about terminology but also about the way knowledge is structured. Science relies on precision, clarity, and universality in its communication, and for much of the Western scientific tradition, Latin and Greek provided these attributes. Latin, with its strict grammatical rules and precise vocabulary, was used extensively for centuries as the standard language for scholarly work, particularly during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and remained the preferred language for scientific texts well into the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the modern era, however, the language of science has undergone significant changes. Today, **English** has become the dominant language of scientific research and publication. The rise of English in the scientific world has been largely due to the global political, economic, and technological dominance of English-speaking countries, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, during the 20th century. As a result, most scientific journals, conferences, and research are now conducted in English, which has become the de facto international language for most disciplines. However, this shift has raised questions about accessibility, inclusivity, and the future of other scientific languages.

While English is the leading language of modern science, **Latin and Greek** continue to play an important role in scientific nomenclature and the construction of new terms. For example, the **binomial nomenclature** system used to classify species in biology, developed by Carl Linnaeus, is based on Latin and Greek, reflecting their historical significance in scientific classification. Moreover, fields like **medicine**, **chemistry**, and **physics** continue to use Greek and Latin roots to form new words and concepts. For example, terms like **mitosis**, **photosynthesis**, and **atom** all have Greek origins, while many chemical compounds and anatomical terms are derived from Latin.

In summary, while English has become the global language of science, the historical contributions of Latin and Greek remain integral to the structure of scientific knowledge. The development of scientific languages is not just about words, but about the systems through which humanity understands the natural world and communicates these insights to others.

### Cultural Shifts

The cultural shifts in the language(s) of science reflect broader societal changes in politics, economy, and technology. For centuries, Latin was the universal language of scholarly work across Europe. It was the language of the Church, academia, and intellectual discourse, and thus served as the common ground for scientists, philosophers, and theologians. The use of Latin also represented a continuity of knowledge from the ancient Greeks and Romans, whose intellectual achievements were highly regarded by European scholars during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

However, the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries and the subsequent rise of national identity and political power began to shift the linguistic landscape. As scientific communities grew and new discoveries were made, scholars and scientists in various European countries began to publish their works in their own native languages, marking the beginning of the decline of Latin as the universal scientific language. For instance, in the 17th century, **Isaac Newton** published his revolutionary work *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* in Latin, but later generations saw more and more scientific works being published in the vernacular languages of Europe, particularly English, French, and German.

The **Industrial Revolution** and the technological innovations of the 19th century further accelerated this shift. The increasing globalization of trade, exploration, and intellectual exchange required a common language to facilitate communication across borders. By the 20th century, English had solidified its position as the dominant language of science, driven in large part by the rise of the United States as a global scientific leader and the influence of English-speaking scientific journals and conferences. This cultural shift also paralleled the growing economic and military power of English-speaking countries, particularly after World War II.

One of the most significant cultural shifts in the language of science was the increasing democratization of scientific knowledge. As the language of science moved from Latin to vernacular languages, it allowed a broader range of people to participate in the scientific discourse. This included not only a growing number of non-European scientists but also the general public, whose access to scientific knowledge improved with the rise of native language publications and educational reforms.

In recent years, the trend toward the dominance of English has been reinforced by the rapid spread of digital technology and the internet, which has further globalized communication. The ability to access scientific papers, online courses, and research in English has made it the de facto global language for scientific work. However, this shift also poses challenges for non-English speakers, who may have less access to the global scientific community or face barriers in contributing to scientific discourse.

### The Death of Latin

The death of Latin as the primary language of science represents a cultural and intellectual shift that has had significant implications for the structure and practice of science itself. For many centuries, Latin served as the language of learning, philosophy, and scholarly communication, not only in the sciences but also in religion, law, and literature. It was the medium through which knowledge was transmitted across generations and cultures, and it united scholars from different parts of Europe who spoke different languages.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, however, as the importance of national identity and language grew, Latin began to lose its status as the universal language of science. The rise of the nation-state, along with the burgeoning field of modern languages, led to a shift in how knowledge was communicated. Scholars began to write in their native languages, making scientific work more accessible to a wider audience but also fragmenting the once-universal discourse. For example, **Charles Darwin’s** landmark work *On the Origin of Species* was written in English, reflecting the growing prominence of English in scientific communication.

The decline of Latin was also tied to the rise of **modern scientific disciplines**, which, in many cases, sought to distance themselves from the religious and philosophical frameworks in which Latin had once been so deeply embedded. Scientific knowledge became more empirical, experimental, and less reliant on the classical ideals of ancient philosophy. With the advent of the **scientific method** and new technologies that demanded more precise, technical language, Latin increasingly seemed less relevant to the needs of contemporary scientists.

By the 20th century, English had emerged as the dominant language of scientific research, and Latin, though still used in specific contexts like nomenclature and taxonomy, had largely fallen out of everyday scientific use. Latin’s decline in scientific communication is part of a broader pattern of the reduction of Latin's role in other areas of intellectual life, including law, theology, and philosophy, as these fields also began to adopt vernacular languages.

Despite its diminished role, Latin has not completely disappeared from scientific language. It continues to be used in specific contexts, especially in the **naming** of species, chemical compounds, and anatomical structures. It is also still taught in many classical studies programs as part of a broader education in the humanities. While Latin is no longer the primary language of science, its legacy remains deeply embedded in scientific terminology and thought.

## Eurocentric Narratives

The history of science, like many other fields of study, has traditionally been told from a Eurocentric perspective, often excluding or minimizing the contributions of non-European civilizations. This **Eurocentric narrative** has its roots in colonialism, imperialism, and the dominance of European powers over much of the world from the 15th century onward. As European explorers and scholars ventured into other parts of the world, they often regarded non-European cultures as inferior or less advanced, leading to the dismissal or neglect of the rich scientific and intellectual traditions found outside Europe.

### Exclusion of Non-European Contributions

One of the key ways in which non-European contributions to science have been excluded is through the focus on European thinkers and their contributions as the pinnacle of intellectual achievement. Many of the foundational figures in the scientific revolution, such as **Galileo**, **Newton**, and **Descartes**, are celebrated as the "fathers" of modern science, while scholars from non-European regions who made significant contributions were either ignored or forgotten. For example, scholars from **Islamic** and **Persian** civilizations, who preserved and expanded upon ancient Greek and Roman knowledge during the Middle Ages, were often excluded from the European historical narrative of science.

In the fields of **astronomy**, **mathematics**, and **medicine**, non-European societies made significant advances that were often overlooked by European scholars. We have seen several contributions from scholars and scientists in the pre-modern Islamic world, and how scientists like Jabir have preserved and expanded upon scientific methodologies and practices from the ancient Mediterranean. In ancient India, for instance, mathematicians developed the concept of zero and made important contributions to algebra and geometry. In China, early astronomical observations and the invention of the compass, paper, and gunpowder had a profound impact on the development of science and technology. Yet, these contributions were often dismissed by European scholars who regarded their own scientific achievements as superior and more advanced.

The **colonial mentality** that shaped much of European science often led to the erasure of indigenous knowledge systems. For example, **African**, **Native American**, and **Pacific Islander** cultures developed sophisticated systems of knowledge about agriculture, medicine, and ecology, yet these were often regarded as "primitive" or "superstitious" by European colonizers and slavers. Even today, many indigenous knowledge systems are not fully recognized in academic and scientific circles, despite their profound understanding of the natural world.

The exclusion of non-European contributions to science has led to a skewed and incomplete history of scientific development, one that fails to acknowledge the richness of global knowledge and the diverse ways in which different cultures have engaged with the natural world.

### Ethnosciences

**Ethnoscience** is the study of the knowledge systems and practices of indigenous and non-Western cultures, including their understanding of the natural world. These knowledge systems, often passed down through oral traditions, encompass fields such as **ethnobotany** (the study of plants and their uses), **ethnoastronomy** (the study of how cultures understand celestial bodies), **ethnomedicine** (traditional medical practices), and **ethnoecology** (the study of human-environment interactions). Ethnosciences provide insight into how different cultures have developed sophisticated systems of knowledge that are often deeply integrated with their spiritual beliefs, social practices, and everyday life.

Unlike the **Western scientific tradition**, which is grounded in empirical observation and experimentation, many indigenous knowledge systems are **holistic**, emphasizing the interconnection between human beings, nature, and the cosmos. For instance, many indigenous cultures view the natural world as a living, interconnected system, where every plant, animal, and element of the environment has intrinsic value and purpose. This worldview often leads to a profound understanding of local ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, and ecological balance, which has been invaluable for preserving biodiversity and responding to environmental challenges.

Ethnosciences challenge the idea that modern, Western science is the only valid form of knowledge. They highlight the importance of **cultural diversity** in scientific practice and offer alternative ways of thinking about the natural world. For example, indigenous knowledge about medicinal plants and their therapeutic properties has contributed to the development of modern pharmaceuticals. The **willow tree**, for instance, was used by ancient cultures to treat pain, and it was later found to contain salicylic acid, the active ingredient in **aspirin**.

In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the value of ethnosciences in the broader scientific community. Scholars are increasingly engaging with indigenous knowledge systems, often in collaboration with indigenous communities, to better understand ecosystems, preserve traditional practices, and develop new solutions to environmental problems. However, there is still work to be done to ensure that these knowledge systems are respected, preserved, and integrated into mainstream scientific discourse in an equitable and ethical way.

The study of ethnosciences also raises important questions about intellectual property, cultural appropriation, and the ownership of traditional knowledge. As Western scientists continue to draw from indigenous knowledge for commercial gain, it is crucial to ensure that these communities are properly credited and compensated for their contributions.

## Introduction to Taxonomy

***Taxonomy*** comes from the Greek words *taxis* (ordering, arrangement) and *nomia* (law, method). Simply put, a taxonomy is a method of ordering or arranging a collection of items. You may have heard of Bloom's taxonomy, which is a system for categorizing educational goals. Maslow's hierarchy of needs categorizes human needs at a physical and psychological level. The taxonomy of programming languages sorts different programming languages according to syntax, function, or use (though you'd be hard-pressed to find one universal taxonomy).

In biology, however, *taxonomy* takes on a specific meaning.

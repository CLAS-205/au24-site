# Lesson 4: Taxonomy

## Objectives

1. Learn about the history of taxonomy and its uses in biological classification
2. Discover the role of Greek and Latin terms in rank-based taxonomy

## Introduction to Taxonomy

***Taxonomy*** comes from the Greek words *taxis* (ordering, arrangement) and *nomia* (law, method). Simply put, a taxonomy is a method of ordering or arranging a collection of items. You may have heard of Bloom's taxonomy, which is a system for categorizing educational goals. Maslow's hierarchy of needs categorizes human needs at a physical and psychological level. The taxonomy of programming languages sorts different programming languages according to syntax, function, or use (though you'd be hard-pressed to find one universal taxonomy).

In biology, however, *taxonomy* takes on a specific meaning. Taxonomy refers to the specific method of classifying and naming living organisms. The modern taxonomical system uses a **rank-order system**, which organizes living organisms in a hierarchical structure. Each level of the hierarchy is called a **rank**.

The rank-order system of taxonomy organizes living organisms into a hierarchical structure, facilitating a clear understanding of their relationships and classifications. This system consists of several ranks, each representing a different level of biological classification. The primary ranks include domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Each rank groups organisms based on shared characteristics, with higher ranks encompassing broader categories and lower ranks being more specific. For instance, in the classification of the gray wolf, the hierarchy is as follows: Domain (Eukarya), Kingdom (Animalia), Phylum (Chordata), Class (Mammalia), Order (Carnivora), Family (Canidae), Genus (Canis), and Species (Canis lupus).

At the top of this hierarchy is the domain, which represents the broadest category. Within each domain, organisms are further divided into kingdoms based on more specific shared traits. For example, the kingdom *Animalia* includes all animals, while the kingdom *Plantae* encompasses plants. As you move down the ranks, each level becomes increasingly specific, allowing for a hierarchical classification of organisms that share similar traits. This structured approach enables scientists to identify and study organisms systematically, fostering a better understanding of their evolutionary relationships.

> In fact, the word *specific* originally was used to mean "pertaining to members of the same type"

Each rank also serves as a way to communicate important biological information. For example, the **family** rank groups organisms that share more specific characteristics, such as behavioral traits or genetic similarities. In the case of the gray wolf, being part of the *Canidae* family indicates its close relationship with other canids, like domestic dogs and foxes. The **genus** rank further narrows down the classification, indicating a close-knit group of species that share a recent common ancestor. Finally, the **species** rank identifies individual organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, forming the fundamental unit of biological classification.

## Latin and Greek in Scientific Naming

Greek and Latin play a crucial role in taxonomy, the science of naming and classifying organisms. This dual-language foundation stems from the historical influence of Greek philosophers and Roman scholars in early scientific discourse. Latin, as the language of scholarship and science during the Renaissance, became the primary medium for formalizing species names. Greek, on the other hand, contributes to many of the root words used to describe characteristics of organisms. For example, the genus name Homo (Latin for "man") is combined with the species descriptor sapiens (Latin for "wise"), resulting in Homo sapiens, the scientific name for humans.

Taxonomy operates through a hierarchical classification system that organizes living organisms into various categories based on shared characteristics. This system is structured in ranks, starting with broad categories like domain and kingdom and narrowing down to species. For instance, in the classification of the domestic cat, the hierarchy is as follows: Domain (Eukarya), Kingdom (Animalia), Phylum (Chordata), Class (Mammalia), Order (Carnivora), Family (Felidae), Genus (Felis), and Species (Felis catus). Each level of this hierarchy groups organisms that share certain traits, allowing scientists to understand relationships and evolutionary history more clearly.

## The History of Taxonomy

Though the practice of naming, classifying, and identifying plant and animal species was vital to the development of early civilizations (as it was important to know which plants were edible, medicinal, and poisonous), the first widely-used system of classification in the West came from the Greek philosopher Aristotle. In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle introduced a hierarchical classification system based on shared characteristics among living beings. He divided organisms into two main categories: plants and animals, further subdividing them based on observable traits such as habitat and physical attributes. This rudimentary system laid the groundwork for future classification efforts, emphasizing the importance of systematic observation in understanding biodiversity.

During the Middle Ages, the study of taxonomy stagnated in Europe as classical texts were largely overlooked. However, Islamic scholars preserved and expanded upon Aristotle's work, developing more sophisticated classifications that included additional criteria. These scholars contributed to the cataloging of medicinal plants and animals, emphasizing practical applications in botany and medicine. This period also saw the compilation of herbals, which were essential texts that categorized plants based on their uses rather than strictly their biological characteristics.

The Renaissance marked a renewed interest in nature and science, leading to significant advancements in taxonomy. The invention of the printing press allowed for the widespread distribution of scientific texts, facilitating the sharing of knowledge among scholars.

The work of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in the late 17th century also played a pivotal role in taxonomy. Tournefort is best known for his classification of plants, which he organized based on their floral structures. His system focused on the physical characteristics of plants, rather than a strict hierarchical system. Tournefort's influence was significant, as he established the concept of a *genus*, which later taxonomies adopted and expanded upon. His classifications emphasized the importance of morphology in understanding plant relationships, paving the way for more systematic botanical studies.

## Carl Linnaeus (and his contemporaries)

Much of the contemporary taxonomic system owes greatly to Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist and botanist. Linnaeus introduced a binomial nomenclature system in the 18th century, which revolutionized taxonomy by providing a standardized method for naming species. Each organism was assigned a two-part Latin name, consisting of the genus and species. This system not only brought clarity and consistency to naming practices but also facilitated communication among scientists worldwide. Linnaeus’s works, particularly *Systema Naturae*, systematically classified thousands of species, providing a framework that is still in use today.

Linnaeus emphasized observable characteristics, grouping organisms based on physical traits such as flower structure in plants and anatomical features in animals. This empirical approach allowed for a clearer understanding of the relationships among species and laid the groundwork for further advancements in biological classification. While he used the rank-order system in almost the same way that we use it today, he created a shorthand for cataloguing different species.

Linnaeus was a popular and celebrated figure in his own time, and he amassed several students which he called his "apostles". Among these were Peter Kalm, Pehr Löfling, Daniel Rolander, Daniel Solander, and Carl Peter Thunberg. Linnaeus instructed these apostles to go out on expeditions into different parts of the world to record and send samples of the species they encountered there. Unfortunately, many died on the expeditions, and Linnaeus took to naming other organisms in their honor (Kalmia, Loeflingia, Rolandra, Solandra, and Thunbergia, respectively).

> Linnaeus was fond of naming organisms after mythological figures or people he knew. One of Linnaeus's close friends from university was Peter Artedi, the "father of ichthyology". While in school, the two friends had discovered a common interest in the natural world and classifications. They vowed to embark on a shared quest to name and classify all the world's species. However, Artedi's untimely death at the age of 30 meant that Linnaeus had to continue most of the work alone. Later, he would name a flower for his friend, the *Artedia squamata*.

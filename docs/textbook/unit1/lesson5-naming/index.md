## Lesson 5: Naming Conventions

### Objectives

1. Provide more context for how organisms are named
2. Become familiar with common bases in naming

## Order-Rank Naming

In the previous lesson, we saw how each living organism is classified according to the **order-rank system**. Aside from the genera that are named after people, most of the ranks will be able to tell you something specific about the organisms in that group.

## Common Names vs. Scientific Names

## Decolonizing Names

In November of 2023, the American Ornithological Society announced that it would change the English names of every bird that was named after a person, or whose name was deemed offensive or outdated.

# Project 1: Scientific Names

## Objectives

1. Objective 1
2. Objective 2

## Relevance

In this project, you will apply your understanding of bioscientific vocabulary by interpreting scientific names and matching them to the organisms they describe. Scientific names, often derived from Latin or Greek roots, convey essential information about the characteristics, habitat, or classification of an organism. By breaking down these names into their components, you can uncover their meanings and gain insights into the biology of each species. This project will enhance your ability to connect vocabulary with real-world applications in biology, reinforcing the foundational knowledge you've acquired in this course.

## Assignment

### Problem 1: Name Analysis

For each of the organisms and their scientific names, provide a breakdown of all roots in the scientific name. Explain the meaning of each name based on its components, and give 1-2 sentences explaining why this name makes sense for the particular organism.

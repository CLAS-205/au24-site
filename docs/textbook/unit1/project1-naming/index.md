# Project 1: Scientific Names

## Objectives

1. Apply knowledge of Greek and Latin roots to interpret scientific names
2. Understand how scientific names and common names are related (or not!)

## Relevance

In this project, you will apply your understanding of bioscientific vocabulary by interpreting scientific names and matching them to the organisms they describe. Scientific names, often derived from Latin or Greek roots, convey essential information about the characteristics, habitat, or classification of an organism. By breaking down these names into their components, you can uncover their meanings and gain insights into the biology of each species. This project will enhance your ability to connect vocabulary with real-world applications in biology, reinforcing the foundational knowledge you've acquired in this course.

## Assignment

### Problem 1: What's in a Name?

For each of the organisms and their scientific names, provide a breakdown of all roots in the scientific name. Explain the meaning of each name based on its components, and give 1-2 sentences explaining why this name makes sense for the particular organism.

1. American flamingo (*phoenicopterus ruber*)
2. Mexican golden trout (*oncorhynchus chrysogaster*)
3. Western honey bee (*apis mellifera*)
4. Blacktip reef shark (*carcharhinus melanopterus*)
5. Five-needle pine tree (*pinus parviflora*)
6. Wood ear mushroom (*auricularia polytricha*)

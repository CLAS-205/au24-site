## Lesson 1: Introduction to Bioscientific Word-Building

### Objectives

1. Understanding the importance of bioscientific vocabulary
2. Identifying Latin and Greek roots and their meanings
3. Learning how word-building works

### The Importance of Bioscientific Vocabulary

In this lesson, we’re going to start diving into the foundations of word formation, starting with the relevant parts of speech, then getting into the prefixes and bases that are introduced in the first lesson. As an additional note on terminology, I will use “root” and “stem” interchangeably to collectively refer to individual word parts. Two of the types of roots we’ll encounter in this lesson are prefixes and bases.

### Prefixes, Suffixes, Bases

In bioscientific vocabulary, each root is a prefix, a suffix, or a base. Prefixes generally come at the *beginning* of a word, suffixes generally at the *end*, and bases in the *middle*. This means that, depending on where a root is found in a word, it may alternate between any of the three. For example, in the word **biology**, the root "bio-" is a prefix. However, in **antibiotic**, it's a base.

### Parts of Speech

A little bit of grammar never hurt anyone! In fact, it's helpful to understand how certain parts of speech work in order to develop a better intuition for how roots work together in an unfamiliar word. There are many, but in this class, I want to focus on four main ones: nouns, adjectives, verbs, and prepositions. These core four will be the basis of the roots that we learn in this class, and they’re the most relevant to the word formation patterns and exercises that you’ll see in this class. Let’s take some time to get to know them.

#### Nouns

The first part of speech is the noun, which basically represents any person, place, thing, or idea. Most of the bases that the book provides will be from nouns. Often, these will be body parts, like ODONT-, meaning “tooth”; POD- or -PUS, meaning “foot”; and STOM- or STOMAT-, meaning “mouth”. One thing of note is that I will usually try to follow the book’s spelling and conventions in my slides as well, to avoid confusion. There will be a couple of times that I change it up, usually to demonstrate something else. But for the most part, I’ll follow the book in terms of denoting these bases. Because a lot of these terms come from the medical fields, many of the bases you’ll see will be from body parts. But there are also a fair number that come from plants and animals, as well as abstract concepts or shapes. I don’t think we’ve seen any in the first couple of lessons, but that’s something to keep an eye out for.

Generally, noun bases will tell you what kinds of objects you’re dealing with. You may get a lot of the same prefixes or suffixes, but the meaning of the word can change because that basic noun is different. As an example, there are a lot of surgical procedures which end in -ectomy, which we’ll see later means “to cut out”. And depending on what noun base you put at the beginning, you change the  surgical procedure. You change what is being cut out. An appendectomy deals with the appendix, while a splenectomy deals with the spleen.

#### Adjectives

Now, bases can also be formed from adjectives, which are basically any word that describes a noun. These can refer to size, quality, color, number, condition—pretty much anything that can be a descriptor. 
And because adjectives modify or describe nouns, you’ll often see adjective bases alongside noun bases, like cryptogam, which combines the adjective base CRYPT- with the noun base GAM-, which we’ll see in Lesson 2. 
Most of the adjective bases you’ll see in this book are purely descriptive in the sense that they describe a state of being, like “slow” or “hidden”. We’ll see colors throughout the later chapters, and some quantitative and numeric descriptors later on.
Now some adjectives can stand alone in these terms, but since they’re often paired up with nouns, they will usually give you information on what the nouns are doing in longer terms. Some of the examples under the entry for CRYPT- in the book (which means “hidden”) have a lot of different noun bases, most of which we haven’t learned yet. But what they all have in common is that whatever noun base is there is hidden in some way. Similar with BRADY-, which means “slow”. You might even be able to infer what the noun bases mean just from the definition of the word and knowing the adjective bases.

#### Verbs

Now the last part of speech that forms the bases in this book are verbs. Verbs are action words, or they can describe a state of being. So here, “you read”, “you are reading”, “to read a book” are all forms of the verb “read”.

One way to tell whether a base is formed from a verb is to check whether its definition is in the infinitive; in other words, does it have this form, “to verb”. You can think of Buzz Lightyear’s catchphrase, “to infinity and beyond”, to remember the infinitive. Probably 9 times out of 10, if you see an infinitive, you’ll know that the base has come from a verb.

In terms of what they signify in the vocabulary examples and terminology, verbs occupy a space sort of between nouns and adjectives. Verbs bases tend to denote processes, movement, or states of being. They rarely stand on their own and usually have at least some prefix, suffix, or other base. When they mix with prefixes and suffixes, they change direction or space. When they mix with nouns, they describe a process that happens to that noun. And if you think about how verbs work in English, that makes some sense. It’s difficult to have an action without direction or without someone or something doing the action.

#### Prepositions

Now, the last part of speech I want to cover in this video is the preposition. It’s hard to give one solid definition of a preposition in either Greek or English without some examples. Generally speaking, prepositions are words that denote temporal, spatial, or directional relationships. So something like “after” in the phrase “after dinner” gives you a sense of time. “inside the house” gives you a sense of space. “towards me” gives you a sense of direction. You can also think of prepositions as connector words that describe these kinds of relationships.

Nearly all the prefixes in the book come from Greek prepositions. And just like the examples that I’ve given in English, because prepositions are, at their core, connective words, they don’t stand on their own.

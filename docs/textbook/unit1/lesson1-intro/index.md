## The Importance of Bioscientific Vocabulary

In this lesson, we’re going to start diving into the foundations of word formation, starting with the differences between prefixes, suffixes, and bases; and then introducing relevant parts of speech. As an additional note on terminology, I will use “root” and “stem” interchangeably to collectively refer to individual word parts. Two of the types of roots we’ll encounter in this lesson are prefixes and bases.

## Prefixes, Suffixes, Bases

In bioscientific vocabulary, each root is a prefix, a suffix, or a base. Prefixes generally come at the *beginning* of a word, suffixes generally at the *end*, and bases in the *middle*. This means that, depending on where a root is found in a word, it may alternate between any of the three. For example, in the word **biology**, the root "bio-" is a prefix. However, in **antibiotic**, it's a base.

## Parts of Speech

A little bit of grammar never hurt anyone! In fact, it's helpful to understand how certain parts of speech work in order to develop a better intuition for how roots work together in an unfamiliar word. There are many, but in this class, I want to focus on four main ones: nouns, adjectives, verbs, and prepositions. These core four will be the basis of the roots that we learn in this class, and they’re the most relevant to the word formation patterns and exercises that you’ll see in this class. Let’s take some time to get to know them.

### Nouns

A noun represents a person, place, thing, or idea. 

### Adjectives

Adjectives are modifiers that describe nouns. These can be colors, numbers, sizes, or other descriptors. Since they're modifiers, adjective roots are often found in close company to noun roots.

### Verbs

Verbs are action words, or they can describe a state of being. As an example, “you read”, “you are reading”, “to read a book” are all forms of the verb “read”.

One way to tell whether a root is formed from a verb is to check whether its definition is in the infinitive; in other words, does it have this form, “to verb”. You can think of Buzz Lightyear’s catchphrase, “to infinity and beyond”, to remember the infinitive. Probably 9 times out of 10, if you see an infinitive, you’ll know that the base has come from a verb.

In terms of what they signify in the vocabulary examples and terminology, verbs occupy a space sort of between nouns and adjectives. Verbs bases tend to denote processes, movement, or states of being. They rarely stand on their own and usually have at least some prefix, suffix, or other base. When they mix with prefixes and suffixes, they change direction or space. When they mix with nouns, they describe a process that happens to that noun. And if you think about how verbs work in English, that makes some sense. It’s difficult to have an action without direction or without someone or something doing the action.

### Prepositions

It’s hard to give one solid definition of a preposition in English (or Latin and Greek, for that matter) without some examples. Generally speaking, prepositions are words that denote temporal, spatial, or directional relationships. So something like “after” in the phrase “after dinner” gives you a sense of time. “inside the house” gives you a sense of space. “towards me” gives you a sense of direction. You can also think of prepositions as connector words that describe these kinds of relationships.

Nearly all roots with prepositional origins are found at the beginnings of words (i.e., they're often prefixes), and they often attach to verbs.

## Building a Vocabulary

Let's look at some vocabulary in context. When learning new roots, it's often helpful to get a sense for how they show up in words and how they affect meanings.

5. anesthesiologist
6. photosynthesis
7. aquifer

## Reflection Questions

1. Choose any three of the roots from this lesson. What part of speech do you think they come from, and why?
2. Some roots have the same definition but are from different languages. Find a pair of roots with the same definition and look at their spellings. What might this tell you about the roots in the original Latin and Greek?
3. Which roots did you know already before reading this lesson? In what contexts have you seen them? Which roots were unfamiliar?

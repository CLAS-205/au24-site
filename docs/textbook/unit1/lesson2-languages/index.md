## The Greek Alphabet

For this class, you are not going to be tested on your ability to memorize the Greek alphabet. In any situation where you might have to read Greek terms in the original language, you will have the alphabet provided as a reference. Depending on your background, you might already be familiar with some of these letters, or the Greek language itself!

Some Greek letters have similar sounds and shapes as their English counterparts:

| Greek letter  | English letter    |
| :---          | :---              |
| Α α           | A a               |
| Β β           | B b               |
| E ε           | E e               |
| Ι ι           | I i               |
| Ζ ζ           | Z z               |
| Κ κ           | K k               |
| Μ μ           | M m               |
| N ν           | N n               |
| O o           | O o               |
| T τ           | T t               |

There are a couple that look tricky-- lowercase nu may be mistaken for a lowercase V, both uppercase and lowercase rho may look like P, uppercase upsilon may look like an uppercase Y, and lowercase omega resembles a lowercase W.

### Transliteration

Transliteration comes from the Latin roots **trans** (across) and **littera** (letter). It's the process of representing the same sounds in different languages. Since many of us don't speak or read Greek, we need a way of representing those roots in an alphabet that's more familiar to us. You can think of transliteration as a cypher or code to switch between one language and another, while still representing the same sounds.

There are a few Greek letters that have interesting patterns in English transliterations. Wherever you see a C or a CH in Greek, those were letters that were originally represented by a kappa (κ) or a chi (χ). So even though those letters make a K or a hard C sound, they will sometimes be represented in English with the letter C. This is because when we transliterate the kappa to English, we can use either a K or a C, since both letters make the same sound in English.

The rho is the letter that looks something like a P. Sometimes in physics it’s used to represent density. Here, it represents the letter R. The Greek R sound is different from the English R sound, though, because the Greek R sounds is *aspirated* (it's a bit of a rolled-R sound). When transliterating rho to English or Latin, sometimes an H is added after the R to indicate that it’s aspirated. This doesn’t happen all the time, but it is something to be on the lookout for. 

You’ll notice that H is not actually part of the Greek alphabet; whenever you see an H in the bases, prefixes, or suffixes, that tells you that there’s actually an aspirated letter. That’s also why the chi is spelled as CH instead of C. It’s a similar sound, but there’s an aspect of breathiness to it.

Finally, let's look at upsilon (υ). This is a funny letter, since it's sometimes transliterated as a Y, as in **hydro** (water) and **hyper** (above, over), but sometimes it's transliterated as a U, as in **neuro** (nerve) Why is that, when they’re the same letter in Greek?

The answer has to do with part of the reason I’m not asking you to memorize or write out letters in the Greek alphabet. Before English became the common language of communication and science, it was Latin. More world languages use the Latin alphabet than the Greek alphabet, so it was easier to read these terms when they were transliterated. There’s an added quirk that many of the Greek words that we use today actually passed through Latin before arriving into English. So some of the spelling quirks are remnants of Latin as well.

## The Latin Alphabet

The Latin alphabet is virtually the same as English, with the following exceptions:

- There is no W
- There is no K (technically, there is, but it's rarely used)
- U and V are the same letter
- I and J are the same letter

## Reflection Questions

1. What was your experience with the Greek alphabet like before this lesson? In what contexts have you seen Greek letters or words in the original alphabet?
2. What language(s) are you familiar with? Do those languages experience any contraction or assimilation? Give examples.
3. Choose any three preposition roots from this lesson and give three examples each, of words you know that don't appear in this lesson but use those roots. (A total of 9 words, with their definitions)
4. Choose any three Greek roots from the vocabulary you know so far and try transliterating them back to Greek (don't use words that were used in Practice Set A!).

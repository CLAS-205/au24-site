# Project 4: Medical School
{: .no_toc}

1. Synthesize knowledge of Greek and Latin roots from the quarter to determine the meanings behind medical terminology
2. Recognize and translate Latin phrases as they are used in anatomy
3. Interpret unfamiliar medical jargon for general audiences

## Relevance
{: .no_toc}

In this project, you will examine the names of elements and chemical compounds to explore how endings affect the meanings of these names. While the bases in chemical names can provide clearer clues to their core components, the endings are important when it comes to figuring out more details about chemical properties, bonds, and structures. By interpreting how Greek and Latin are used in chemical naming, you'll develop a better sense for the subtle ways in which endings can provide more information about unfamiliar terms.

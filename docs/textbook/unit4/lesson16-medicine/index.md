<!-- The implications of humoralism extended beyond health into the realms of psychology and personality. It posited that individuals could be categorized based on the predominance of certain humors, leading to the four temperamental types: sanguine (blood), choleric (yellow bile), melancholic (black bile), and phlegmatic (phlegm). This intersection of chemistry and psychology further enriched the discourse surrounding human behavior and health, encouraging early scientists and physicians to explore how different substances could influence mood and temperament. -->

{: .no_toc}

1. TOC
{:toc}

## Objectives

1. Learn how endings are used in names of diseases and drugs
2. Overview of how Greek and Latin disease names are formed
3. Introduction to drug naming

## Medical Endings

- -osis, -itis, -ia/-y, -sis
- relate this back to the chemistry lesson

## Medical Naming

## Diseases

- most diseases named after symptoms or body parts affected
- give examples

{: .note}
> Some diseases are named for the people who discovered them (such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's) or after notable people who had them (Lou Gehrig).

## Drugs

### Drug Classes

### Specific Drug Names

1. spasmodic
2. compressor
3. antiseptic
4. hydropoiesis
5. sclera
6. mimesis
7. rupture
8. osteonecrosis
9. hematocyst
10. polyspondyly
11. multisulcate
12. comorbidity
13. abruption
14.

## Reflection Questions

1. Like some organisms we saw in Unit 1, some diseases bear the names of their discoverers (e.g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's). Do you find this problematic or misleading? Why or why not?
2. What similarities and differences do you see in how endings are used in medical and chemical vocabulary?
3. Look through the drug naming guide provided in the end of the lesson. What endings do you notice? How are they similar or different from the ones we've learned in class?
4. Why do you think it's important for drugs to have both scientific and brand names?

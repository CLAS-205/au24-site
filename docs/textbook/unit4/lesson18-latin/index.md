## Inflecting Nouns

As we saw back in Lesson 3, Latin is an **inflected language**, which means that the spellings of certain words change depending on how they're used in a sentence. Now, this lesson is not intended to be a crash course in Latin. Rather, it should introduce you to the way that Latin nouns are formed and used in preparation for looking at anatomical and medical terms that retain Latin in its original forms instead of through Anglicization. Inflection is not exclusive to Latin, but it's quite different from English. The important thing to remember is that there *is* a pattern to how Latin nouns are formed and used. 

<!-- ### **Gender**  
In Latin, nouns have grammatical gender, which classifies them as masculine, feminine, or neuter. Gender is not necessarily tied to biological sex, as a noun's gender is largely arbitrary. For example, "puer" (boy) is masculine, "puella" (girl) is feminine, and "donum" (gift) is neuter. The gender of a noun affects the forms of adjectives and pronouns that modify it, as they must agree in gender with the noun they describe.

### **Number**  
Number refers to whether a noun is singular or plural. Latin nouns, like many languages, can be either singular (indicating one) or plural (indicating more than one). For example, "dominus" (master) is singular, while "domini" (masters) is plural. The number of a noun also influences the agreement of adjectives, pronouns, and verbs in Latin.

### **Case**  
In Latin, case indicates the grammatical function of a noun in a sentence. There are several cases, each serving a distinct role such as subject, possession, or object. The ending of a noun changes depending on its case, and each declension has its own set of endings. Below are the most commonly used cases:

#### **Nominative**  
The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence, which is the noun performing the action. For example, in the sentence "Puella cantat" (The girl sings), "puella" is in the nominative case as the subject. Nouns in the nominative case are also used for predicate nominatives, which rename the subject, as in "Puer est magister" (The boy is a teacher).

#### **Genitive**  
The genitive case generally indicates possession or association. It is often translated as "of" or "belonging to." For example, in "Liber pueri" (The book of the boy), "pueri" is in the genitive case, showing that the book belongs to the boy. The genitive is also used in expressions of quantity and certain adjectives.

#### **Dative**  
The dative case is used to indicate the indirect object of a sentence, which is usually the recipient of an action. For example, in "Puellae librum dono" (I give the book to the girl), "puellae" is in the dative case, showing the girl as the recipient of the book. The dative can also indicate the purpose or advantage of an action.

#### **Accusative**  
The accusative case marks the direct object of a sentence, which is the noun that directly receives the action. For example, in "Puer librum legere amat" (The boy loves to read the book), "librum" is in the accusative case, as it is the direct object of the verb "legere" (to read). The accusative is also used with certain prepositions to indicate direction or motion towards something.

#### **Ablative**  
The ablative case typically expresses the means, manner, time, or location of an action. It is often translated as "by," "with," or "from." For example, in "Puella cum amica ambulat" (The girl walks with her friend), "amica" is in the ablative case, showing the means of the action. The ablative is used with many prepositions, such as "in" (in), "ab" (by), and "ex" (from), to describe the relationship between the noun and the verb.

### **Declension**  
Declension refers to the system of noun inflection in Latin, where nouns change their endings based on case, number, and gender. Latin nouns are grouped into five declensions, each with its own set of endings for each case and number. For example, in the first declension, which mainly consists of feminine nouns, the nominative singular ending is "-a" (e.g., "puella"), while the accusative singular ending is "-am" (e.g., "puellam"). The declension determines how a noun will change in different cases, and it also helps identify the gender and other grammatical features of the noun. -->

## Gender

**Gender** in Latin is purely grammatical, which means that it doesn’t necessarily describe the gender of the noun itself. This is different from English, which sometimes genders nouns according to what they describe. For example, a *hen* is female, and a *rooster* is male, even though these are both words for a chicken. However, if we were thinking about an inanimate object like a table or a chair, it's hard to conceptualize whether these items can have genders attached to them in English. 

I would want to make the separation between the fact that there is a gender assigned to an actual noun. Gender in this case is more describing its grammatical function, purpose, or the way that it interacts with other modifiers in the language. The Latin language has three genders: **feminine, masculine, and neuter**. 

As I mentioned before, English doesn't have gendered nouns, but if you're familiar with other European languages, many of them have their own gender systems when it comes to nouns. For example, Danish has a common and neuter gender, French has a masculine and feminine gender, and German has masculine, feminine, and neuter.

## Number

Number refers to how many of the nouns there are. There are two possible numbers in Latin, which are the singular or the plural (one or many). The most common way to form plurals in English is to add an S at the end of the word, but there are some exceptions as well. For example, the plural of goose is geese and the plural of cow is sometimes cattle. Sometimes we do say cows, but there is this other form that looks quite different from the word cow. 

## Case

The next property is the case, which refers to how the noun is used in a sentence. Latin actually has seven different cases for ways that nouns can be used, but we're just going to focus on the subject and possessive cases, which in Latin are called the nominative and genitive, respectively. I’ll use the following paradigm for translations. Whenever you see a genitive, you can use the phrase “of the” for translation. For example, the genitive singular of “dog” would translate in English to “of the dog” or “of a dog”. Latin doesn’t have articles like “the” or “a”, so you can supply these on your own.

### Nominative

### Genitive

### Dative

### Accusative

### Ablative

## Declension

The final property that Latin nouns have is **declension**. A declension is like a formula for the type of spelling changes that will occur for a noun. There are five total declensions in Latin, but the more common ones are the first, second, and third.

## Adjectives

In English, the spelling of the adjective doesn't actually change depending on the noun it modifies. The example I gave was saying the phrase “the blue dog”, where “dog” is singular, and “the blue dogs”, where “dogs" is plural. The word “blue” doesn't change between both phrases. 
However, in Latin, adjectives have to agree with their modified nouns in gender, number, and case. So for example “the blue dog” (it's hard to demonstrate gender and case in English, but we can still demonstrate the number), “the blue dog” in the plural would have to become “the blues dogs” for the adjective to change its form to agree with its noun. 
Latin adjectives have to agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case, but they do not have to agree in declension necessarily, so it's completely possible to have a first declension adjective with a fourth declension noun, a third declension adjective with a first declension noun, so on and so forth. 

The most important thing to remember is that all of the properties that nouns had– number, gender, case, and declension– all apply to adjectives as well. So just to review, the number is singular or plural. So there's two of those. There's three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. And then there's two cases, nominative and genitive.

When we're thinking about adjective declensions, there are two declensions of adjectives which I mentioned earlier, the first of which is called the first and second, because its adjectives resemble first declension nouns in the feminine and second declension nouns in the masculine and neuter. The other declension of adjectives is called third declension because it resembles third declension nouns in all genders. Let's quickly review what third declension nouns actually look like.

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you find that the case system makes it easier or harder to understand Latin nouns, and why?
2. Most Latin terminology in medical usage is comprised of nouns and some adjectives. Why do you think there are so few verbs?
3. Choose one of the phrases in the [Latin Phrases in Common Use](#latin-phrases-in-common-use) section. Identify each of the nouns. Then tell which case you think each of the nouns is, and why.
4. Choose any three of the Latin roots from this lesson. Look up and give their original Latin forms (you may refer to Wiktionary or Logeion for most accurate results&mdash; Google translate is not great for this). What gender and declension do they follow?
